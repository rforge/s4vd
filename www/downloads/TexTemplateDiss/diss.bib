  abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long
	list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list
	is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation.
	Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions
	from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance
	of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology
	({GO}). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of
	this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between
	the {GO} terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.
	Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve {GO} group
	scoring using the underlying {GO} graph topology. The algorithms
	are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show
	that both methods eliminate local dependencies between {GO} terms
	and point to relevant areas in the {GO} graph that remain undetected
	with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A
	simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher
	level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

  abstract = {This paper concerns the discovery of patterns in gene expression matrices,
	in which each element gives the expression level of a given gene
	in a given experiment. Most existing methods for pattern discovery
	in such matrices are based on clustering genes by comparing their
	expression levels in all experiments, or clustering experiments by
	comparing their expression levels for all genes. Our work goes beyond
	such global approaches by looking for local patterns that manifest
	themselves when we focus simultaneously on a subset G of the genes
	and a subset T of the experiments. Specifically, we look for order-preserving
	submatrices ({OPSMs}), in which the expression levels of all genes
	induce the same linear ordering of the experiments (we show that
	the {OPSM} search problem is {NP}-hard in the worst case). Such a
	pattern might arise, for example, if the experiments in T represent
	distinct stages in the progress of a disease or in a cellular process
	and the expression levels of all genes in G vary across the stages
	in the same way. We define a probabilistic model in which an {OPSM}
	is hidden within an otherwise random matrix. Guided by this model,
	we develop an efficient algorithm for finding the hidden {OPSM} in
	the random matrix. In data generated according to the model, the
	algorithm recovers the hidden {OPSM} with a very high success rate.
	Application of the methods to breast cancer data seem to reveal significant
	local patterns.},

	data. Our method is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional
	techniques, when applied to large-scale data. Rather than alloting
	each gene to a single cluster, we assign both genes and conditions
	to context-dependent and potentially overlapping transcription modules.
	We provide a rigorous definition of a transcription module as the
	object to be retrieved from the expression data. An efficient algorithm,
	which searches for the modules encoded in the data by iteratively
	refining sets of genes and conditions until they match this definition,
	is established. Each iteration involves a linear map, induced by
	the normalized expression matrix, followed by the application of
	a threshold function. We argue that our method is in fact a generalization
	of singular value decomposition, which corresponds to the special
	case where no threshold is applied. We show analytically that for
	noisy expression data our approach leads to better classification
	due to the implementation of the threshold. This result is confirmed
	by numerical analyses based on in silico expression data. We discuss
	briefly results obtained by applying our algorithm to expression

	change of expression pattern over the subset of samples. Moreover,
	the genes in a bicluster have common transcription factor binding

	transcription factors binding sites, in the corresponding promoter
	sequences, is an evidence that a group of genes in a bicluster are
	co-regulated. Biclusters determined by BCCA also show highly enriched
	functional categories. Using different gene expression datasets,

	biclustering algorithms.The software for BCCA has been developed

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Large sets of data, such as expression profiles from many
	samples, require analytic tools to reduce their complexity. The Iterative
	Signature Algorithm (ISA) is a biclustering algorithm. It was designed
	to decompose a large set of data into so-called 'modules'. In the
	context of gene expression data, these modules consist of subsets
	of genes that exhibit a coherent expression profile only over a subset
	of microarray experiments. Genes and arrays may be attributed to
	multiple modules and the level of required coherence can be varied
	resulting in different 'resolutions' of the modular mapping. In this
	short note, we introduce two BioConductor software packages written
	in GNU R: The isa2 package includes an optimized implementation of
	the ISA and the eisa package provides a convenient interface to run
	the ISA, visualize its output and put the biclusters into biological
	context. Potential users of these packages are all R and BioConductor
	users dealing with tabular (e.g. gene expression) data. AVAILABILITY:

	It is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene
	expression measurements. We propose a novel generative approach for
	biclustering called 'FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'.
	FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear
	dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures
	heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic
	data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model
	selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.On 100 simulated
	datasets with known true, artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA
	clearly outperformed all 11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA
	was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by
	ranking biclusters according to their information content. FABIA
	was tested on three microarray datasets with known subclusters, where
	it was two times the best and once the second best method among the
	compared biclustering approaches.FABIA is available as an R package
	on Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org). All datasets, results

  abstract = {Large-scale gene expression data comprising a variety of cellular
	conditions hold the promise of a global view on the transcription
	program. While conventional clustering algorithms have been successfully
	applied to smaller datasets, the utility of many algorithms for the
	analysis of large-scale data is limited by their inability to capture
	combinatorial and condition-specific co-regulation. In addition,
	there is an increasing need to integrate the rapidly accumulating
	body of other high-throughput biological data with the expression
	analysis. In a previous work, we introduced the signature algorithm,
	which overcomes the problems of conventional clustering and allows
	for intuitive integration of additional biological data. However,
	this approach is constrained by the comprehensiveness of relevant
	external data and its lacking ability to capture hierarchical modularity.We
	present a novel method for the analysis of large-scale expression
	data, which assigns genes into context-dependent and potentially
	overlapping regulatory units. We introduce the notion of a transcription
	module as a self-consistent regulatory unit consisting of a set of
	co-regulated genes as well as the experimental conditions that induce
	their co-regulation. Self-consistency is defined by a rigorous mathematical
	criterion. We propose an efficient algorithm to identify such modules,
	which is based on the iterative application of the signature algorithm.
	A threshold parameter that determines the resolution of the modular
	decomposition is introduced.The method is applied systematically
	to over 1000 expression profiles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
	and the results are presented using two complementary visualization
	schemes we developed. The average biological coherence, as measured
	by the conservation of putative cis-regulatory motifs between four
	related yeast species, is higher for transcription modules than for
	clusters identified by other methods applied to the same dataset.
	Our method is related to singular value decomposition (SVD) and to
	the pairwise average linkage clustering algorithm. It extends SVD
	by filtering out noise in the expression data and offering variable
	resolution to reveal hierarchical organization. It furthermore has
	the advantage over both methods of capturing overlapping modules
	in the presence of combinatorial regulation.http://www.weizmann.ac.il/~barkai/modules},

	to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome
	the limitations of standard clustering approaches for the analysis
	of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples simultaneously.
	The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering,
	allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns
	across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated
	for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods
	have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how
	the different techniques compare with each other with respect to
	the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics
	such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines
	concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available.
	RESULTS: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and
	validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference
	model. Although this model captures the essential features of most
	biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine
	all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer
	algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient
	biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical
	clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that
	(1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical
	clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences
	between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model
	delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.},

  abstract = {The dissection of complex biological systems is a challenging task,
	made difficult by the size of the underlying molecular network and
	the heterogeneous nature of the control mechanisms involved. Novel
	high-throughput techniques are generating massive data sets on various
	aspects of such systems. Here, we perform analysis of a highly diverse
	collection of genomewide data sets, including gene expression, protein
	interactions, growth phenotype data, and transcription factor binding,
	to reveal the modular organization of the yeast system. By integrating
	experimental data of heterogeneous sources and types, we are able
	to perform analysis on a much broader scope than previous studies.
	At the core of our methodology is the ability to identify modules,
	namely, groups of genes with statistically significant correlated
	behavior across diverse data sources. Numerous biological processes
	are revealed through these modules, which also obey global hierarchical
	organization. We use the identified modules to study the yeast transcriptional
	network and predict the function of >800 uncharacterized genes. Our
	analysis framework, samba ({Statistical-Algorithmic} Method for Bicluster
	Analysis), enables the processing of current and future sources of
	biological information and is readily extendable to experimental
	techniques and higher organisms.},

	that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation
	studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties

	models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
	regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent
	work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The

  comment = {We propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso,
	where adaptive weightsare used for penalizing different coefficients
	in the \$l\_1\$ penalty. It performs as well as if the true underlying
	model were given in advance. It is shown to be near-minimax optimal.
	
	It seems safe to conclude that the lasso is an oracle procedure for
	simultaneously achieving consistent variable selection and optimal
	estimation (prediction). There are also solid arguments against the
	lasso oracle statement.
	
	Whether the lasso is an oracle procedure is an important question
	demanding a definitive answer. In particular, we are interested in
	whether the \$l\_1\$ penalty could produce an oracle procedure and,
	if so, how.
	
	The adaptive lasso is essentially a convex optimization problem with
	an \$l\_1\$ constraint. Therefore, the adaptive lasso can be solved
	by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso.
	
	We have shown that the lasso cannot be an oracle procedure. We can
	certainly assign different weights to different coefficients. We
	show that if the weights are data-dependent and cleverly chosen,
	then the weighted lasso can have the oracle properties. The data-dependent
	\$\hat{w}\$ is the key in the theorem. As the sample size grows,
	the weights for zero-coefficient predictors get inflated (to infinity),
	whereas the weights for nonzero-coefficient predictors converge to
	a finite constant.},
