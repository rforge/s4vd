The dashed colored lines correspond to the stability selection threshold according to the pointwise error control. The continuous colored lines represent the estimated set of stable rows and columns with respect to different type one-error levels. The blue horizontal line corresponds to a stability selection threshold of $0.7$. }}{16}

Note that the heatmap shows only those genes that have been selected in at least one bicluster. The colored rectangles indicate the genes and samples that correspond to the three biclusters (red corresponds to Bicluster 1, green to Bicluster 2 and blue to Bicluster 3). }}{25}

The relevance score $M(G,F)$, recovery score $M(F,G)$ and the average proportions of falsely assigned rows $V_{I}(G,F)$ and columns $V_{J}(G,F)$ are described in the supplementary material. The boxplots show the distribution of these validation indices with respect to the $100$ simulated data sets. $\sigma $ indicates the considered noise level. }}{26}
